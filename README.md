# REBA Score Calculation Website

This project is a capstone developed in the final year of my studies. It is a web application designed to calculate the **REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment)** score based on user-provided data. The REBA score is a widely used ergonomic assessment tool that evaluates the level of risk in work-related postures.

The application retrieves user input, processes the data, and calculates the REBA score, providing insights into ergonomic risk levels. The project is built using the **Django framework** and follows modern web development practices.
